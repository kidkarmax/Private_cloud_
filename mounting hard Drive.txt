These stepsare for mounting and allowing Owncloud to store files onto an external hard drive.

1. Firstly if you have an NTFS drive we will need to install an NTFS package by entering the following:

sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
2. Now let’s make a directory we can mount.

sudo mkdir /media/ownclouddrive
3. Now we need to get the GID, UID, and the UUID as we will need to use these soon. Enter the following command for the GID:

id -g www-data
4. Now for the UID enter the following command:

id -u www-data
5. Also if we get the UUID of the hard drive, the Pi will remember this drive even if you plug it into a different USB port.

ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid

Copy the light blue letters and numbers of the last entry (Should have something like -> ../../sda1 at the end of it).

6. Now let’s add your drive into the fstab file so that it will boot with the correct permissions.

sudo nano /etc/fstab
7. Now add the following line to the bottom of the file, updating UID, GUID and the UUID with the values we got above. (The following should all be on a single line)

UUID=DC72-0315 /media/ownclouddrive auto nofail,uid=33,gid=33,umask=0027,dmask=0027,noatime 0 0
8. Reboot the Raspberry Pi, and the drives should automatically be mounted. If they are mounted, we’re all good to go.
